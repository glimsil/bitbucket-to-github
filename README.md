# Bitbucket repo migration #
Please, check out the configuration on config/config.txt (you need to put your credentians there)

It is better to create a personal access token on Github instead of using your password (if you are using MFA it is mandatory).

After configuring the `config.txt` file, to the start the migration, just type: 
    ```
    python3 migrate_team_repo.py
    ```
